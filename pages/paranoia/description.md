# Paranoia

Paranoia is a project I created that allows anybody to take a screenshot of my screen whenever the Paranoia app is open on my computer. I would precommit to a schedule, and if somebody catches me not doing what I should be doing during a timeblock, I would suffer the consequences of my precommitments.

(This project is still a work in progress...)
