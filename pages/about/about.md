# About Me

You may have seen me refer to myself as an aspiring ultralearner. Ultralearning is a learning strategy that is both intense and self-directed, and is an efficient way to quickly pick up new skills when needed. I love learning, and being able to acquire skills quickly is a superpower that I'd love to have. Although I might not be a veteran ultralearner just yet, I'm constantly putting myself through intense learning challenges that guides me along this intense, yet valuable path.

# About This Site

I've wanted to learn Vue for some time, and when Vue Mastery announced that they would open all courses to the public free of charge during the week of April 13<sup>th</sup>, this was my chance to learn the framework I've always been interested in learning.

I swept through the courses and learned how to build a Nuxt.js application, which you're viewing at this moment! I'm also using Vuetify for a beautiful UI, so I can focus more on the content rather than the subtleties of stylesheets.

 I'm also challenging myself to use Pug, Sass, and TypeScript to build my website. You can view the source code at the [Github Repo](https://github.com/leonzalion/website).
